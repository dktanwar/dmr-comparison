Differential methylation: Easy, Fast, Identification and ANnoTation

 by David E. Condon, University of Pennsylvania, 2015-2018.


The minimum coverage used will be 1
You specified the '-f' option, so figures will be made for each and every DMR.
You specified the '-v' option, so a p-value & an adjusted p-value using BH's method will be printed for each DMR.
There are 2 sets to be read
There will be 1 runs.
Run information will be in defiant_run_info.txt

***WARNING***
There is/are 0 label(s), yet 2 sets, just a warning that you may not have correctly labeled data.

There will be 1 runs split among 1 workers.

------
Beginning analysis.



Worker 1/1 is analyzing run 1/1:	sets 1 vs. 2	with cutoffs	c = 1	CpN = 10	d = 1	p = 0.90	P = 10.000000	S = 0
Now analyzing chromosome 18, at iteration loop 1/1
Answers written to set1_vs_set2_c1_CpN10_d1_p0.90_P10.tsv
set1_vs_set2_c1_CpN10_d1_p0.90_P10_q.tsv
Writing answers to set1_vs_set2_c1_CpN10_d1_p0.90_P10_q.tsv
	516092/516095 = 100.0% of nucleotides met minimum coverage and were present with minimum coverage = 1 in every sample.
Finished analysis.
